Adds admin editable widgets to the BP Nouveau group home page BP Legacy Home (Activity) pages with widgets for text, video, members, activity, comments, and comment us.

== Description ==

**NEW FEATURE! Group admin widget allows the group admin to be highlighted separately to the members.

The ability to personalize a groups home page is an important part of letting new group members know exactly what the group is about. BP Nouveau adds a group home page with a widget area that this plugin exploits to allow each group creator to add videos, full featured text and other BuddyPress widgets to this page.

Whilst being designed with BP Nouveau in mind the plugin also embraces backwards compatibility - For users of BP Legacy the plugin adds widget areas to the Activity ( default landing page ) of each group and the site admin can choose to add the widget to either of these locations. In this application most of the BuddyPress widgets are a tad redundant.

The site admin can also choose to configure a preset layout that will be displayed for group owners yet to create their group home page widget area.

The widgets are sortable, so you can obtain exactly the right layout of text videos and BP widgets to suite the group requirement.

The widgets available are:

    Text Widgets: Two of these are available, each supports shortcodes, Rich Text and media based images. Any plugin that adds buttons alongside Add-Media in the editor will also be available, assuming the user has media upload capability.
    Video Widgets: Two of these are included which allow links from YouTube and other video hosting sites to be added.
	Group Admin: Adds a grid of Group Admin and moderators.
    Group Members: Adds a grid of group members.
    Group Activity: Adds a list of the latest activities in the group.
    Group Comments: Adds a filtered list of any updates posted to the group.
    Mention Us: Adds a group comment form.

Using this plugin group creators can at last create simple and effective home pages using a simple and effective front end interface.
